    <h1>ðŸ©° Ballet</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Ballet</strong> (French: [<em>balÉ›</em>]) is a type of performance
      dance that originated during the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth
      century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and
      Russia. It has since become a widespread and highly technical form of
      dance with its own vocabulary. Ballet has been influential globally and
      has defined the foundational techniques which are used in many other dance
      genres and cultures. Various schools around the world have incorporated
      their own cultures. As a result, ballet has evolved in distinct ways.
