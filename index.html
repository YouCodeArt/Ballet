    <h1>ðŸ©° Ballet</h1>
    <p>
      Ballet (French: [balÉ›]) is a type of performance dance that originated
      during the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century and later
      developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since
      become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own
      vocabulary. Ballet has been influential globally and has defined the
      foundational techniques which are used in many other dance genres and
      cultures. Various schools around the world have incorporated their own
      cultures. As a result, ballet has evolved in distinct ways.
